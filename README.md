# Supply_Chain_Analysis

Supply Chain Analytics is very important for any business to keep: 
-	Customers happy by delivering the right item to the right place at the right time
-	Investors happy by eliminating waste and minimizing costs,
But how a business can know if they need to buy more inventories, hire new workers, find a new supplier? They need a tool for their Decision-Making.
Supply chain analytics is a set of tools and methods that utilize supply chain data to help business figure out what just happened, why it happened, and what might happen in the future.

For any Supply Chain Analytics, we need to develop good KPIs based on the business goals.
For example, if we discovered that the success of the business is based on the on-time delivery and low cost, we need to map all of the business stakeholders, suppliers, manufacturers, transportation companies, customers, to support the business goals. 
Mapping the business supplier chain helps to understand the business processes and develop good KPIs to measure the supplier chain performance. The supplier chain map is the first step in the Supply Chain Analytics and consist of a list of things we know about the business and things we still need to find out.
In Supply Chain Analytics, we use four kind of analytics. Each of them give different kind of information:
1.	Descriptive analytics tell us what happened in the past, and what is happening now
2.	Diagnostic analytics tell us why that happened
3.	Predictive analytics tell us what might happen in the future
4.	Prescriptive analytics recommend us what we should do next
If we do the Supply Chain Analytics right, we help the business to decrease risk, increase customer satisfaction and revenue
